        If you cannot make an in-app purchase, try the steps below.<br><br>
        •Make sure you're connected to a Wi-fi or cellular data network. An internet connection is required to make in-app purchases.<br>
        •Go into Settings > General > Restrictions and make sure that the ability to make in-app purchases is not disabled. If restrictions are disabled, you may skip this step. If you have additional Restrictions problems or cannot access restrictions, contact an engineer with the link below.<br>
		•Try clicking the purchase button again, and make sure to click the button in the middle so that you don't miss it.<br>
        •Try quitting the app from the app switcher and relaunching it.<br>
		•Try restarting your device.

        <p>Contact an engineer if your problems persist after taking the steps above. After contacting an engineer, you'll recieve an email containing instructions to solve your issue. Usually, we deliver emails a few hours after your request is made, but response times can range from a few minutes to a few days. When you get your email, feel free to reply to it with any other questions you may have. Please do not contact an engineer with feedback about our apps; you can write a review in the App Store instead. All emails not related to an issue that you're encountering with an app will be ignored, because we have other emails to respond too as well. Thank you in advance for following these guidelines, and we hope we can solve your issue as soon as possible.
