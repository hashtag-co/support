            If you'd like more information about one of our apps (#Guess, Not Interested Phrases, Frying Pan, Dodge and Fetch, Travel Checklist), just contact an engineer below. We'll be happy to fill you in on anything you may be curious about.<br><br>
            If you can't find the topic you want to read about on our main page, you may also contact an engineer. We'll be happy to add the topic for you, and let you know what to do to fix your problem in the meantime.

        <p>Contact an engineer if your problems still persist after viewing the popular topics. After contacting an engineer, you'll receive an email containing instructions to solve your issue. Usually, we deliver emails a few hours after your request is made, but response times can range from a few minutes to a few days. When you get your email, feel free to reply to it with any other questions you may have. Please do not contact an engineer with feedback about our apps; you can write a review in the App Store instead. All emails not related to an issue that you're encountering with an app will be ignored, because we have other emails to respond to as well. Thank you in advance for following these guidelines, and we hope we can solve your issue as soon as possible.
